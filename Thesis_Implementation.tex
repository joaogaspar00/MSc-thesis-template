\section{Numerical Model}
\label{section:model}

Description of the numerical implementation of the models explained in Chapter~\ref{chapter:background}.

If needed, pseudo-codes can be included as exemplified in Algorithm~\ref{euclid}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Euclidâ€™s algorithm}\label{euclid}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{Euclid}{$a,b$}\Comment{The g.c.d. of a and b}
   \State $r\gets a\bmod b$
   \While{$r\not=0$}\Comment{We have the answer if r is 0}
      \State $a\gets b$
      \State $b\gets r$
      \State $r\gets a\bmod b$
   \EndWhile\label{euclidendwhile}
   \State \textbf{return} $b$\Comment{The gcd is b}
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}

\section{Verification and Validation}
\label{section:verification}

Basic test cases to compare the implemented model against other numerical tools (verification) and experimental data (validation).
